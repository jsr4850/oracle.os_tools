#               Generate tnsnames.ora for Oracle serverside and client side
#               * Requires Oracle 12c instant client or higher
#               * ansible should be installed
#               * Python 2.7 or higher with cx_Oracle module installed
#               By Ulf Hellstrom,oraminute@gmail.com , EpicoTech 2019
#
#               How to use THE SHORT VERSION:
#
#               1. Check hosts file so hosts match your ssh configuration
#               2. Check tns_config.cfg 
#               3. Run tnsgen as $ ./tnsgen in a copied directory of this gitrepo (See README)
#               4. Output produce logfile and tnsname.ora_<date and timestamp>
#               5. Upload file to server if necessary.
#               6. Merge with you own local tnsnames.ora
#
